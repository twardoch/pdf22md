# pdf22md-swift

A high-performance PDF to Markdown converter built with modern Swift features including async/await, actors, and structured concurrency.

## Features

- **Modern Swift**: Uses Swift 5.7+ features including async/await, actors, and result builders
- **Structured Concurrency**: Concurrent page processing with TaskGroup and proper cancellation
- **Memory Safe**: Automatic memory management with value types where appropriate
- **Type Safe**: Strong typing with enums, associated types, and generic constraints
- **Actor-Based Assets**: Thread-safe image processing with actors
- **Progress Streaming**: Real-time progress updates with AsyncSequence

## Building

### Using Swift Package Manager
```bash
# Build the project
swift build

# Build optimized release
swift build -c release

# Run tests
swift test

# Install executable
swift build -c release

pdf22md -i document.pdf -o document.md

# Extract images to assets folder
pdf22md -i report.pdf -o report.md -a ./assets

# Customize DPI and concurrency
pdf22md -i large.pdf -o large.md -d 300 --max-concurrency 8

# Use with pipes
cat document.pdf | pdf22md > document.md

# Verbose output with progress
pdf22md -i document.pdf -o document.md --verbose
```

### Programmatic Usage

```swift
