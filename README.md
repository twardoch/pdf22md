A blazingly fast PDF to Markdown converter for macOS.

`pdf22md` is a command-line tool that extracts all text and image content from a PDF file and converts it into a clean Markdown document. It uses Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) to process pages and save images in parallel, making it exceptionally fast for multi-page documents.

## Key Features

- **High-Speed Conversion**: Uses all available CPU cores to process PDF pages concurrently
- **Intelligent Heading Detection**: Analyzes font sizes and usage frequency to automatically format titles and headings (`#`, `##`, etc.)
- **Asset Extraction**: Saves raster and vector images into a specified assets folder and links them correctly in the Markdown file
- **Smart Image Formatting**: Automatically chooses between JPEG (for photos) and PNG (for graphics with transparency) to optimize file size and quality
- **Flexible I/O**: Reads from a PDF file or `stdin` and writes to a Markdown file or `stdout`
- **Customizable Rasterization**: Allows setting a custom DPI for converting vector graphics to bitmaps

## Installation

## Usage

```
Usage: pdf22md [-i input.pdf] [-o output.md] [-a assets_folder] [-d dpi]
  Converts PDF documents to Markdown format
  -i <path>: Input PDF file (default: stdin)
  -o <path>: Output Markdown file (default: stdout)
  -a <path>: Assets folder for extracted images
  -d <dpi>: DPI for rasterizing vector graphics (default: 144)
```

### Examples

```bash
# Convert a PDF file to Markdown
pdf22md -i document.pdf -o document.md

# Convert with images saved to an 'assets' folder
pdf22md -i report.pdf -o report.md -a ./assets

# Convert with custom DPI for vector graphics
pdf22md -i presentation.pdf -o presentation.md -a ./images -d 300

# Use with pipes
cat document.pdf | pdf22md > document.md

# Convert and view in less
pdf22md -i manual.pdf | less
```
