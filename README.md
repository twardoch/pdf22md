### Project Description

**pdf22md** is a high-performance, command-line utility for macOS that converts PDF documents into clean, structured Markdown. Leveraging parallel processing, it rapidly extracts text, intelligently infers heading structures from font styles, and saves embedded images into a designated assets folder. It's an essential tool for developers, writers, and anyone needing to programmatically access and repurpose content from PDF files.

### Project Documentation (for README.md)

# pdf22md

A blazingly fast PDF to Markdown converter for macOS.

`pdf22md` is a command-line tool that extracts all text and image content from a PDF file and converts it into a clean Markdown document. It uses Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) to process pages and save images in parallel, making it exceptionally fast for multi-page documents.

### Key Features

  * **High-Speed Conversion**: Uses all available CPU cores to process PDF pages concurrently.
  * **Intelligent Heading Detection**: Analyzes font sizes and usage frequency to automatically format titles and headings (`#`, `##`, etc.).
  * **Asset Extraction**: Saves raster and vector images into a specified assets folder and links them correctly in the Markdown file.
  * **Smart Image Formatting**: Automatically chooses between JPEG (for photos) and PNG (for graphics with transparency) to optimize file size and quality.
  * **Flexible I/O**: Reads from a PDF file or `stdin` and writes to a Markdown file or `stdout`.
  * **Customizable Rasterization**: Allows setting a custom DPI for converting vector graphics to bitmaps.

### Installation

Once the Homebrew tap is set up (see plan below), installation is simple:

```bash
brew install <your-username>/pdf22md/pdf22md
```

### Building from Source

To build the project manually, you need Xcode Command Line Tools installed.

```bash
# Clone the repository (once it's public)
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/pdf22md.git
cd pdf22md

# Compile the tool
make

# Install it to /usr/local/bin
sudo make install
```

### Usage

```
Usage: pdf22md [-i input.pdf] [-o output.md] [-a assets_folder] [-d dpi]
  Converts PDF documents to Markdown format
  -i <path>: Input PDF file (default: stdin)
  -o <path>: Output Markdown file (default: stdout)
  -a <path>: Assets folder for extracted images
  -d <dpi>: DPI for rasterizing vector graphics (default: 144)
```

**Example:**

```bash
# Convert a local PDF file and save images to an 'assets' folder
pdf22md -i report.pdf -o report.md -a ./assets
```

## Plan for Professional Repository Reorganization

This plan will transform the current flat structure into a professional, maintainable, and distributable open-source project.

### Step 1: New Directory Structure

The source code will be moved into a `src` directory to separate it from project-level configuration, documentation, and build files.

```text
pdf22md/
├── .github/                      # GitHub-specific files
│   ├── workflows/
│   │   └── build-release.yml     # GitHub Action for CI and releases
│   └── ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
│       └── bug_report.md         # Template for bug reports
├── src/                          # All Objective-C source files
│   ├── AssetExtractor.h
│   ├── AssetExtractor.m
│   ├── ContentElement.h
│   ├── ContentElement.m
│   ├── main.m
│   ├── PDFMarkdownConverter.h
│   ├── PDFMarkdownConverter.m
│   ├── PDFPageProcessor.h
│   └── PDFPageProcessor.m
├── docs/                         # Additional documentation
│   └── PARALLEL_PROCESSING.md
├── .gitignore                    # Comprehensive gitignore for macOS/Obj-C
├── LICENSE                       # An open-source license (e.g., MIT)
├── Makefile                      # Updated to handle the new structure
└── README.md                     # The documentation from above
```

**Action Items:**

1.  Create `src` and `docs` directories.
2.  Move all `.h` and `.m` files into `src/`.
3.  Move `PARALLEL_PROCESSING.md` into `docs/`.
4.  Update the `Makefile` to reference files in `src/`.

### Step 2: Update the Makefile

The `Makefile` must be modified to find the source files in `src/` and to respect a `PREFIX` variable for portable installation, which is crucial for Homebrew.

**`Makefile` Modifications:**

```makefile
CC = clang
CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra -O2 -fobjc-arc
FRAMEWORKS = -framework Foundation -framework PDFKit -framework CoreGraphics -framework ImageIO -framework CoreServices
TARGET = pdf22md

# Define source directory
SRC_DIR = src
SOURCES = $(wildcard $(SRC_DIR)/*.m)
OBJECTS = $(SOURCES:.m=.o)

# Default prefix for installation
PREFIX ?= /usr/local

all: $(TARGET)

$(TARGET): $(OBJECTS)
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(FRAMEWORKS) -o $(TARGET) $(OBJECTS)

$(SRC_DIR)/%.o: $(SRC_DIR)/%.m
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

clean:
    rm -f $(OBJECTS) $(TARGET)

install: $(TARGET)
    install -d $(DESTDIR)$(PREFIX)/bin
    install -m 755 $(TARGET) $(DESTDIR)$(PREFIX)/bin/

uninstall:
    rm -f $(DESTDIR)$(PREFIX)/bin/$(TARGET)

.PHONY: all clean install uninstall
```

### Step 3: Create a Comprehensive `.gitignore`

The current ignore files are minimal. A professional project needs a robust `.gitignore` for macOS and Objective-C development.

**`.gitignore` Contents:**

```gitignore
# Build products
build/
*.o
$(TARGET) # The executable file itself

# macOS
.DS_Store
.AppleDouble
.LSOverride

# Thumbnails
._*

# Files that might appear on external disk
.Spotlight-V100
.Trashes

# Editor-specific
.vscode/
*.swp
.idea/
.cursorindexingignore
.specstory/
```

### Step 4: Add GitHub Actions for CI & Release Automation

Create a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build the tool on every push and create a release binary when a Git tag is pushed.

**File: `.github/workflows/build-release.yml`**

```yaml
name: Build and Release

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  release:
    types: [ created ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: macos-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Build the tool
      run: make

    - name: Run a basic check
      run: ./${{ env.TARGET_NAME }} -h

  create-release:
    if: github.event_name == 'release'
    runs-on: macos-latest
    needs: build

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Build the binary
      run: make

    - name: Create Tarball Archive
      run: |
        tar -czvf pdf22md-macos-x86_64.tar.gz pdf22md
        
    - name: Upload Release Asset
      uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        upload_url: ${{ github.event.release.upload_url }}
        asset_path: ./pdf22md-macos-x86_64.tar.gz
        asset_name: pdf22md-macos-x86_64.tar.gz
        asset_content_type: application/gzip
```

This workflow builds the project and, upon creating a release on GitHub (e.g., for `v1.0.0`), attaches the compiled binary as a downloadable asset.

### Step 5: Implement Homebrew Installation

The easiest way for macOS users to install a CLI tool is via Homebrew. This requires creating a "tap," which is a separate GitHub repository.

**Plan:**

1.  Create a new public GitHub repository named `homebrew-pdf22md`.

2.  In that new repository, create the following file structure:

    ```text
    homebrew-pdf22md/
    └── Formula/
        └── pdf22md.rb
    ```

3.  **Create the Homebrew Formula (`pdf22md.rb`):** This Ruby script tells Homebrew how to download and install your tool.

    ```ruby
    # Formula/pdf22md.rb
    class Pdf22md < Formula
      desc "A blazingly fast PDF to Markdown converter for macOS"
      homepage "https://github.com/<your-username>/pdf22md"
      # This URL points to the asset created by the GitHub Action
      url "https://github.com/<your-username>/pdf22md/releases/download/v1.0.0/pdf22md-macos-x86_64.tar.gz"
      sha256 "..." # The SHA256 checksum of the tarball will go here
      version "1.0.0"

      # Since it's a pre-compiled binary, there are no dependencies to build.
      # If you were to build from source, you'd add:
      # depends_on :xcode => :build

      def install
        # The tarball contains just the binary, so we just install it.
        bin.install "pdf22md"
      end

      test do
        # A simple test to ensure the binary runs
        assert_match "Usage: pdf22md", shell_output("#{bin}/pdf22md -h")
      end
    end
    ```

**Release and Installation Workflow:**

1.  Finalize a new version of the `pdf22md` tool.
2.  Create a new release on the `pdf22md` GitHub repository (e.g., `v1.0.1`). This triggers the action to build and upload the `tar.gz` asset.
3.  Download the asset and compute its SHA256 checksum.
4.  Update the `url` and `sha256` in the `pdf22md.rb` formula in your `homebrew-pdf22md` repository and push the change.
5.  Users can now `brew upgrade pdf22md` to get the latest version.
