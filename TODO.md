# TODO - Post-Restructuring Tasks and Release Preparation

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission: Complete Implementation Polish and Prepare for Public Release

Current Status: **95% Complete** â†’ Target: **100% Complete**

With the major codebase restructuring into two self-contained implementations complete, focus on implementation polish and open source release preparation.

## ðŸ“‹ **Priority Tasks (Final 5% Completion)**

### Phase 1: Implementation Completion (CRITICAL) âœ… STRUCTURE COMPLETE
- [x] **Codebase Restructuring**: Organized into pdf22md-objc/ and pdf22md-swift/
- [x] **Self-Contained Builds**: Each implementation has its own build system
- [x] **Shared Component Integration**: Moved to implementation-specific directories
- [x] **Import Path Fixes**: All references updated for new structure
- [x] **Build Verification**: Both implementations compile successfully
- [ ] **Swift Implementation**: Complete the PDF conversion logic (currently framework only)
- [ ] **API Consistency**: Ensure both implementations have identical interfaces
- [ ] **Cross-Platform Testing**: Verify builds on different macOS versions

### Phase 2: Code Quality and Testing (HIGH)
- [x] **Basic Test Framework**: Swift tests pass, Objective-C executable works
- [ ] **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Add conversion accuracy tests
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare implementation performance
- [ ] **Memory Leak Testing**: Ensure proper resource management
- [ ] **Edge Case Testing**: Handle malformed PDFs gracefully

### Phase 3: Release Preparation (HIGH)
- [x] **Project Documentation**: Updated README.md files for both implementations
- [x] **Build Instructions**: Clear build and installation guides
- [ ] **CLI Interface**: Add proper argument parsing to Swift implementation
- [ ] **Package Distribution**: Create installers for both implementations
- [ ] **Version Management**: Implement semantic versioning system
- [ ] **License and Legal**: Verify MIT license compliance

### Phase 4: Open Source Readiness (HIGH)
- [ ] **GitHub Actions**: Set up automated CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] **Homebrew Formula**: Create formula for easy installation
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Generate comprehensive API docs
- [ ] **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Create contributor guidelines
- [ ] **Issue Templates**: Set up bug report and feature request templates

### Phase 5: Community and Marketing (MEDIUM)
- [ ] **User Guide**: Create comprehensive usage documentation
- [ ] **Example Gallery**: Showcase conversion examples
- [ ] **Performance Metrics**: Document speed and accuracy benchmarks
- [ ] **Blog Post**: Write announcement and technical deep-dive
- [ ] **Social Media**: Prepare launch materials

## ðŸŽ¯ **Success Criteria for 100% Completion**

### Technical Metrics
- [x] **Self-Contained Implementations** (each with own build system)
- [x] **Clean Directory Structure** (pdf22md-objc/, pdf22md-swift/)
- [x] **Working Build Systems** (Makefile for ObjC, Package.swift for Swift)
- [ ] **Feature Parity** (both implementations have same capabilities)
- [ ] **API Consistency** (identical interfaces across implementations)

### Quality Benchmarks
- [x] **Successful Compilation** (both implementations build without errors)
- [x] **Test Framework** (basic test suites in place)
- [ ] **Performance Validation** (speed and memory benchmarks)
- [ ] **Cross-Implementation Testing** (identical output verification)
- [ ] **Production Readiness** (error handling, edge cases, documentation)

## ðŸ“Š **Expected Final Results**

**Quantitative**:
- [x] **Two Self-Contained Implementations** (pdf22md-objc/, pdf22md-swift/)
- [x] **Eliminated Directory Redundancy** (removed swift/, shared/, build/, test/)
- [x] **Consolidated Build Systems** (implementation-specific)
- [ ] **Complete Swift Implementation** (PDF conversion logic)
- [ ] **Comprehensive Test Coverage** (>90% code coverage)

**Qualitative**:
- [x] **Professional Project Structure** (clear separation of concerns)
- [x] **Enterprise-Grade Organization** (self-contained implementations)
- [ ] **Community Contribution Ready** (documentation, guidelines)
- [ ] **Production-Ready** (robust error handling, comprehensive testing)

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps Priority**

1. **Complete Swift Implementation** (add PDF conversion logic to match ObjC)
2. **Comprehensive Testing** (accuracy, performance, edge cases)
3. **API Documentation** (generate docs for both implementations)
4. **Release Automation** (CI/CD, package distribution)
5. **Community Preparation** (contributing guidelines, issue templates)
