# TODO - Streamlining and Optimization

## 🎯 Mission: Streamline pdf22md Codebase

Transform pdf22md from a functional but complex multi-implementation project into a clean, maintainable, and efficient codebase with minimal duplication and maximum clarity.

## 📋 Immediate Priority Tasks (Phase 1: Foundation Cleanup)

### Legacy Code Removal
- [ ] Remove `pdf22md-objc/archived-old-implementation/` directory entirely
- [ ] Clean up references to old implementation in documentation
- [ ] Update .gitignore to prevent future legacy accumulation

### Build System Consolidation  
- [ ] Remove duplicate `pdf22md-objc/build.sh` (keep root build.sh as single source)
- [ ] Remove duplicate `pdf22md-objc/Makefile` (consolidate into root Makefile)
- [ ] Remove duplicate `pdf22md-objc/release.sh` and other duplicate scripts
- [ ] Consolidate version detection logic into single location
- [ ] Test unified build system works correctly

### Documentation Consolidation
- [ ] Merge `pdf22md-objc/README.md` content into root `README.md`
- [ ] Remove duplicate README files in implementation directories  
- [ ] Update all documentation references to point to single source
- [ ] Ensure man pages are not duplicated across implementations

## 🏗️ High Priority Tasks (Phase 2: Code Organization)

### Shared Component Extraction
- [ ] Create `shared/` directory for common components
- [ ] Extract image format detection algorithm into shared utility
- [ ] Consolidate PDF error handling patterns into shared code
- [ ] Create common asset path generation utilities
- [ ] Extract font analysis utilities to shared components

### Directory Structure Cleanup
- [ ] Reorganize files according to clean structure in PLAN.md
- [ ] Move implementation-specific code to `implementations/` subdirectories
- [ ] Consolidate test resources into single shared directory
- [ ] Separate build artifacts from source code

## 🧪 Medium Priority Tasks (Phase 3: Testing and Quality)

### Testing Framework Unification
- [ ] Consolidate test PDF resources into single shared directory
- [ ] Create implementation-agnostic test runners
- [ ] Eliminate duplicate test validation logic
- [ ] Add performance comparison tests between implementations

### Performance and Quality
- [ ] Enhance benchmark utility with comprehensive metrics
- [ ] Create standardized test document corpus
- [ ] Add memory usage and leak detection
- [ ] Implement performance regression testing

## ✅ Recently Completed

- [x] **Swift Toolchain Error Handling**: Enhanced build scripts for SWBBuildService.framework issues
- [x] **Troubleshooting Documentation**: Created TROUBLESHOOTING.md
- [x] **Issues Cleanup**: Resolved and documented issues 102 and 201
- [x] **Codebase Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis using repomix
- [x] **Strategic Planning**: Created detailed PLAN.md for streamlining

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Immediate Goals (This Week)
- [ ] **Code Reduction**: Remove >5,000 lines of duplicate/legacy code
- [ ] **File Reduction**: Reduce total files by >20% through consolidation  
- [ ] **Build Simplification**: Single build system instead of multiple variants
- [ ] **Documentation**: Single authoritative README and documentation set

### Quality Improvements
- [ ] **Maintainability**: Changes require updates in only one location
- [ ] **Clarity**: Clear separation between shared and implementation-specific code
- [ ] **Developer Experience**: Single entry point for building and testing
- [ ] **Professional Organization**: Clean, logical directory structure

## 🚀 Implementation Approach

1. **Start with Foundation Cleanup** (lowest risk, highest impact)
2. **Make incremental changes** with validation after each step
3. **Test builds frequently** to ensure nothing breaks
4. **Update documentation** as changes are made
5. **Commit small, focused changes** for easy rollback if needed

## 📊 Progress Tracking

**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Foundation Cleanup  
**Next Milestone**: Clean, consolidated codebase with eliminated duplication  
**Timeline**: Complete Phase 1 within 1 week
