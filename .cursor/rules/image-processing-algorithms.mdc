# image-processing-algorithms

The image processing system implements intelligent format selection and optimization for PDF asset extraction:

### Format Selection Algorithm (Importance: 85)
- Images with transparency -> PNG format
- Graphics <100x100 pixels -> PNG format 
- Photos/complex images (>256 colors) -> JPEG format
- Samples up to 10,000 pixels for color complexity analysis
- Checks for alpha channel presence in format decisions

### Asset Optimization (Importance: 75)
- Automatic quality optimization for photographs
- JPEG quality set to 85% for optimal size/quality balance
- Vector graphics rasterization at configurable DPI
- Smart asset directory management with relative path linking

Relevant files:
```
src/AssetExtractor.h
src/AssetExtractor.m
```

Key business rules:
1. Color complexity threshold: 256 unique colors
2. Small image threshold: 100x100 pixels
3. Sample size limit: 10,000 pixels
4. JPEG quality setting: 85%
5. Default vector DPI: 144
