# data-flow

The data transformation pipeline consists of three main stages with distinct data flows:

### 1. PDF Content Extraction Flow (Importance: 95)
- Input PDF document stream parsed into discrete content elements
- Font metrics and statistics gathered during initial parse
- Text elements tagged with style attributes and positioning data
- Images separated into raster/vector categories with source metadata
- Element hierarchy maintained through page-position tracking

### 2. Parallel Processing Pipeline (Importance: 90)
- Page content distributed across worker threads via GCD
- Font statistics aggregated through thread-safe collection
- Synchronized element arrays preserve document ordering
- Concurrent image asset extraction with sequence preservation
- Vector graphics rasterization based on DPI settings

### 3. Markdown Generation Flow (Importance: 85)  
- Font hierarchy analysis converts to heading levels
- Image assets exported with optimized format selection
- Asset references inserted with relative path linking
- Text formatting attributes translated to Markdown syntax
- Document structure rebuilt from processed elements

Key Data Transformation Points:
- PDF content stream → ContentElement objects
- Font metrics → Heading level assignments
- Vector paths → Rasterized images
- Image data → Optimized asset files
- Structured content → Markdown syntax

Relevant Components:
- src/PDFMarkdownConverter.{h,m}
- src/ContentElement.{h,m}
- src/AssetExtractor.{h,m}
- src/PDFPageProcessor.{h,m}
