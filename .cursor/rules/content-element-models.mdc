# content-element-models

The content element model system implements two primary domain models for representing extracted PDF content:

### TextElement Model
Importance Score: 95
- Captures text-specific attributes:
  - Heading level detection based on font statistics
  - Formatting attributes (bold, italic)
  - Positional information for maintaining document structure
  - Font metrics for hierarchy analysis

### ImageElement Model  
Importance Score: 90
- Manages both raster and vector image content:
  - Source type tracking (vector vs raster)
  - Format classification for optimal storage
  - Asset path management for markdown linking
  - Dimension and transparency analysis

### Element Relationships
Importance Score: 85
- Maintains document hierarchy through:
  - Parent-child relationships between elements
  - Sequential ordering based on page position
  - Nested structure preservation
  - Cross-element references
