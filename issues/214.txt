Completely rewrite PLAN.md and also adjust TODO.md as a linearized itemized version of PLAN.md to reflect the actual steps we need to do next, given the following priorities: 

## Task 1
Above all prioritize the following in PLAN.md and TODO: we want the ObjC implementation to be   called 'pdf21md' and the Swift implementation to be called 'pdf22md'. The entire project   must be reorganized around that. Analyze the current project and into PLAN.md as the topmost   priority write the steps that we need to take to make it happen. Make sure to plan for   adjusting all necessary core and auxiliary files. 

## Task 2
Improve code based on this: When I run `./test_both.sh` then both implementations compile, and then both output 134 PNGs into the specified asset folders, but none implementation produces the actual Markdown files which are the MAIN purpose of the whole exercise. Instead, we get this output:
