ISSUE 102 & 201 RESOLUTION
===================

Problem:
--------
Two build script issues were preventing successful builds:

1. `declare -A` bash incompatibility error
   - Error: "declare: -A: invalid option"
   - Root cause: Bash 3.x doesn't support associative arrays

2. SWBBuildService framework loading issue in Swift build
   - Error: "Library not loaded: @rpath/SWBBuildService.framework"
   - Root cause: Corrupted or incomplete Swift toolchain installation

Solutions Implemented:
---------------------

1. Fixed bash incompatibility:
   - Replaced associative array `declare -A build_results` with simple variables
   - Changed from `build_results["objc"]` to `build_results_objc`
   - Updated all references throughout build.sh

2. Enhanced Swift build resilience:
   - Added Swift toolchain health check before attempting build
   - Implemented graceful fallback when Swift toolchain is corrupted
   - Added informative error messages with recovery instructions
   - Modified build.sh to continue with Objective-C when Swift fails

Results:
--------
- Objective-C build: ✓ WORKING
- Swift build: ✗ BLOCKED (system Swift toolchain issue)
- Build script: ✓ ROBUST (handles mixed success gracefully)

The build script now:
- Detects and reports Swift toolchain issues clearly
- Provides recovery instructions (xcode-select --install)
- Continues with successful builds when one implementation fails
- Gives clear status reporting for both implementations

Note: The Swift toolchain issue requires system-level resolution by the user:
`xcode-select --install` or reinstalling Xcode Command Line Tools.
