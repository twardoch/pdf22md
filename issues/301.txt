Run ./build.sh and ./test_both.sh, then analyze their output and analyze the entire codebase ( captured in ./llms.txt ). Implement necessary fixes for failures. 

Analyze PLAN.md and TODO.md, and work on the issues listed there. As you work, periodically update CHANGELOG.md and PLAN.md and TODO.md to reflect the recent changes, and periodically run ./build.sh and also ./test_both.sh to check the progress.
